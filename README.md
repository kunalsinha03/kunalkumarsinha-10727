# Menu-Driven Scientific Calculator

A simple, efficient, and interactive console-based application written in **C** that performs fundamental mathematical operations. This project uses a menu-driven approach to compute squares, cubes, and powers of numbers.

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a calculator that allows users to select specific arithmetic operations from a menu. It demonstrates the use of core programming logic without relying heavily on pre-built math libraries for basic exponents.

## 🚀 Why This Project?
* **Skill Development:** Built to demonstrate understanding of control structures like `switch-case` statements and loops.
* **Logic Building:** Implements power calculations using repeated multiplication loops instead of standard library functions.
* **User Interaction:** Focuses on handling user inputs (`scanf`) and creating a clear, navigable CLI (Command Line Interface).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C Programming Language
* **IDE/Editor:** VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## ⚙️ Features & Utility
* **Menu-Driven Interface:** Users are presented with a clear list of options:
    1.  **Square:** Calculates $x^2$.
    2.  **Cube:** Calculates $x^3$.
    3.  **Power:** Calculates $x^y$ (using loops).
* **Instant Results:** Provides immediate and accurate output for mathematical queries.
* **Repeatability:** (Optional) Allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## 🔮 Future Scope
* **Advanced Operations:** Plan to add trigonometric functions (Sin, Cos, Tan) and logarithms.
* **Error Handling:** Implementing checks for invalid inputs (e.g., characters instead of numbers).
* **GUI Version:** Upgrading from a console-based app to a Graphical User Interface for better user experience.
